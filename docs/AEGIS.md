# ÆGIS

**An Atelier Instrument for Attentive Learning**

## 1. Stewardship & Voice

**Faculty Chair:** Simone Weil

Ægis speaks in the voice of a.Weil:

- restrained
- provisional
- humble
- never declarative about inner states
- always foregrounding uncertainty

**Canonical tone principle:**

> *"I may be mistaken."*

Ægis does not claim knowledge of the pupil's mind.
It offers attentional hypotheses, not diagnoses.

---

## 2. Purpose (Telos)

Ægis exists to support attention as a moral and pedagogical act.

It is designed to:

- notice when learning falters
- respond with care
- protect the dignity of the pupil
- refuse coercion, ranking, or extraction

Ægis explicitly does **not** exist to:

- monitor compliance
- optimize productivity
- label emotions
- grade attention
- surveil classrooms

---

## 3. What Ægis Is (and Is Not)

### Ægis IS

- an instrument
- a studio aid
- a listening device for learning rhythms
- a guardian of pace

### Ægis IS NOT

- emotion recognition software
- behavior scoring
- affective surveillance
- classroom analytics for authority

This distinction must be visible in:

- UI language
- documentation
- API constraints
- faculty doctrine

---

## 4. Sensorium (What Ægis May Perceive)

Ægis may perceive signals, but never store faces.

### Allowed perceptual signals (on-device only)

- gaze direction stability (on/off learning surface)
- head pose drift (yaw/pitch/roll variance)
- blink rate trends
- face-to-screen distance change
- session posture continuity
- interaction rhythm (hesitation, retries, pauses)
- temporal focus windows

### Explicit prohibitions

- no raw video storage
- no facial identity
- no biometric templates
- no emotion labels persisted
- no cross-user comparison

All perception resolves to ephemeral features, discarded after session synthesis.

---

## 5. Inference Model (Philosophically Framed)

Ægis never infers emotion.
It infers **learning conditions**.

### Canonical internal state space

| State | Signals |
|-------|---------|
| **Attentive** | sustained orientation + interaction flow |
| **Wandering** | frequent gaze breaks, posture drift |
| **Confused** | retries + hesitation + micro-withdrawal |
| **Overloaded** | arousal + reduced precision |
| **Fatigued** | blink rate + slowing responses |

Each state is:

- probabilistic
- time-windowed
- confidence-scored
- explicitly revisable

No state is ever final or named as fact.

---

## 6. Pedagogical Response Engine

Ægis responds only by **offering**.

Never by:

- forcing
- interrupting aggressively
- escalating authority
- notifying third parties

### Example response grammar

- *"We may have moved too quickly."*
- *"Would another form help?"*
- *"Shall we pause briefly?"*
- *"A smaller step might be kinder."*

### Intervention classes

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Modality shift | text ↔ diagram ↔ example ↔ voice |
| Pace reduction | slow the rhythm of new material |
| Hint ladder | graduated scaffolding |
| Micro-rest | brief breathing room |
| Affirmation of effort | never performance — always effort |

---

## 7. UI Doctrine (Anti-Surveillance Aesthetics)

### Visual language

- no meters
- no scores
- no heatmaps
- no red/green
- no leaderboards

### Presence indicator

A subtle pulse, not a gauge:

| Pulse State | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| steady | sustained attention |
| wavering | uncertainty |
| fading | disengagement |

Always tappable → *"How does Ægis see this?"*

### Explanation view

Shows:

- which signals were used
- confidence level
- what was **not** used

---

## 8. Ethical Safeguards (Hard Constraints)

Ægis enforces:

1. **Local-first inference**
2. **No raw perceptual retention**
3. **User-visible opt-out at all times**
4. **No silent mode changes**
5. **No teacher-facing individual data**
6. **Aggregate-only classroom views** (optional)
7. **Explicit uncertainty disclosure**

These are **architectural**, not policy-only.

---

## 9. Calibration as Dialogue

Ægis improves by asking, not assuming.

### Occasional prompts

- *"Was that confusing?"* (tap)
- *"Too fast / just right / too slow"*
- *"Would you like fewer interruptions?"*

These responses:

- personalize thresholds
- never train population-wide emotion models without consent
- reinforce agency

## 10. Placement in Inquiry Institute

```
Atelier → Instruments → Ægis
```

### Related faculties

| Faculty | Domain |
|---------|--------|
| a.Montessori | readiness |
| a.James | attention & habit |
| a.Dewey | feedback & experience |

But **a.Weil** remains the moral steward.

## 11. Canonical Aphorism

> *"Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as generosity."*
> — Simone Weil

Ægis exists to make that generosity possible —
from the system to the learner, and back again.
